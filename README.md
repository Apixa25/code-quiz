## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://apixa25.github.io/code-quiz/)

This is a coding quiz with multiple choice questions.  It is coded completely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  The purpose for building this is to showcase my ability to code in these languages as well as my ability to break down a project of this type into its basic parts in order to build it out. 

What I personally find exciting about this bit of code is how the JavaScript dynamically updates the HTML and CSS on the fly in order to change the look of the page to do things like remove the banner and replace it with the questions.  This is not done by pre-making pages and showing them like slides.  This is done by telling the JavaScript how you want it to change the HTML and CSS depending on the game player's input. 

The things that this quiz does:
* Ask questions with multiple choice answers.
* The quiz is controlled by a countdown timer that starts when the quiz starts and ends the quiz when the timer has run to zero, or the player has answered all the questions.
* There is a time penalty of 10 seconds for every wrong answer. 
* The player scores 10 points for every right answer. There is no point penalty for wrong answers.
* At the end of the game the player is given the chance to enter their name and their score is saved in the browser persistently so that they can compare their ‚Äúhigh scores‚Äù with other players.

## Learning Points 



At first glance it would seem easy to build a quiz like this.  But that is only if you are good at breaking large problems down into small manageable ones.  Let me show you the list of functions that were required to make this quiz possible in this way:

* What happens when you click on something in the quiz form?
* Show the Question
* What happens when the Game is Over?
* Show the timer
* Start the timer
* If correct answer
* If wrong answer
* Remove the banner
* Remove the timer
* What happens when you click the Start Button?

The user has looked through your whole README, and gotten familiar with your application. 
This is where you take credit, and make it easy for them to learn more about you!
Direct them to the following:
- Your GitHub Profile
- Your LinkedIn
- Your Portfolio Website
- And Anything Else You Want!

Give credit where credit is due! 

If you Pseudocode or Pair Program with someone else, give them kudos in your Contributors section!


## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.

If you followed tutorials, include links to those here as well.


## License

The last section of a good README is a license. This lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project. If you need help choosing a license, use [https://choosealicense.com/](https://choosealicense.com/)

üèÜ The sections listed above are the minimum for a good README, but your project will ultimately determine the content of this document. You might also want to consider adding the following sections.

## Badges

Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, consider adding a heading called "Features" and listing them there.

## Contributing

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you will want to add guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
