## Description 

[Visit the Deployed Site](https://apixa25.github.io/code-quiz/)

This is a coding quiz with multiple choice questions.  It is coded completely in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  The purpose for building this is to showcase my ability to code in these languages as well as my ability to break down a project of this type into its basic parts in order to build it out. 

What I personally find exciting about this bit of code is how the JavaScript dynamically updates the HTML and CSS on the fly in order to change the look of the page to do things like remove the banner and replace it with the questions.  This is not done by pre-making pages and showing them like slides.  This is done by telling the JavaScript how you want it to change the HTML and CSS depending on the game player's input. 

The things that this quiz does:
* Ask questions with multiple choice answers.
* The quiz is controlled by a countdown timer that starts when the quiz starts and ends the quiz when the timer has run to zero, or the player has answered all the questions.
* There is a time penalty of 10 seconds for every wrong answer. 
* The player scores 10 points for every right answer. There is no point penalty for wrong answers.
* At the end of the game the player is given the chance to enter their name and their score is saved in the browser persistently so that they can compare their “high scores” with other players.

## Learning Points 



At first glance it would seem easy to build a quiz like this.  But that is only if you are good at breaking large problems down into small manageable ones.  Let me show you the list of functions that were required to make this quiz possible in this way:

* What happens when you click on something in the quiz form?
* Show the Question
* What happens when the Game is Over?
* Show the timer 
* Start the timer 
* If correct answer
* If wrong answer
* Remove the banner
* Remove the timer 
* What happens when you click the Start Button?
